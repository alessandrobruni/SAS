* **Analisys of the activation of new service by the merchants stores**: in early 2020 the company launched a new online service that customers could activate independently for payments service.
The service had some difficulties in IT releasing, but overall the feedback from customers who had used it was positive.
At the end of the year it was necessary to understand
